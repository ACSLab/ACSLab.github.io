	<h2> Welcome to the GitHub Page of the Autonomous Collective Systems
         Laboratory at Arizona State University.</h2>
        <p> Our research focuses on the modeling and analysis of behaviors in
            both biological and engineered collectives and the design and
            validation of scalable control strategies for multi-robot systems.
            The main goals of our research are to: </p>

        <ul>
            <li> Develop control frameworks for desiging robot behaviors
                 provably produce target collective behaviors;
            </li>
            <li> Elucidate the mechanisms of self-organization in nature
                 and translate them into robust strategies for robots.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p> Our interdisciplinary approach to research is enabled by the
            diversity of the lab membersâ€™ academic backgrounds, including
            mechanical, electrical, and aerospace engineering; robotics and
            mechatronics; mathematics and physics; and computer science.  The
            lab is under the direction of Prof. Spring Berman, assistant
            professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.
        </p>
